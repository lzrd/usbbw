# =============================================================================
# Position Label Mappings
# =============================================================================
# Framework laptops use ACPI physical_location attributes.
# "upper" = near hinge (rear), "lower" = near front edge (front)
# "left" in horizontal_position seems to mean the outer edge of the panel

[position_labels.vertical]
upper = "Rear"   # Near hinge
lower = "Front"  # Near front edge

[position_labels.panel]
left = "Left"
right = "Right"

[position_labels.horizontal]
left = "Outer"
center = ""
right = "Inner"

# =============================================================================
# USB Port Capabilities (Framework 13 AMD Ryzen AI 300)
# =============================================================================
# Port 1 (Left Rear):   USB4 + DisplayPort
# Port 2 (Left Front):  USB 3.2 only (no DP)
# Port 3 (Right Rear):  USB4 + DisplayPort
# Port 4 (Right Front): USB 3.2 + DisplayPort
#
# Note: ACPI physical_location only reports specific location for some ports.
# Other ports report center/center which is filtered as non-specific.
